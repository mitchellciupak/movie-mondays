# TODO

- [ ] Automate QR Code Generation
    - [QR API](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/qr-code-api/)
    - Could optionally create a web endpoint, map that to the QR Code, and change what that endpoint points to instead of adding a new QR to each flyer and notification

- [ ] After Beta Meetings, Reach out to people in the office directly to ask them to attend. Follow up with them to thank them as well

- [ ] Create First Digital Flyer and Template
